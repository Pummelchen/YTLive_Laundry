# Release and build rules — YTLive_Laundry

The release and build standard for this repository.

**Part 1 is generic** and identical in every Pummelchen repository. **Part 2 is this
repository's own section**, and it wins wherever the two disagree.

This file is a **deployed copy** — do not edit it here. *For maintainers:* the
master is `docs/release-rules.md` in the `TinyTitan` repository, which holds Part 1
once and every repository's Part 2 side by side. Edit the master, then bring this
copy and the other repositories' copies into step by hand. An agent working in this
repository should treat this file as authoritative and does not need to leave the
repository.

# Part 1 — Generic rules

## 1.1 Scope

These apply to any repository that produces a **runnable artifact**: a binary, a
library, an image, a package. Repositories that only hold documents, data or
configuration are out of scope, and should say so in their Part 2 section rather
than adopting a release process they cannot use.

## 1.2 Non-negotiable

1. **Apple Silicon only.** Build native `arm64`. This covers M1–M6. Never
   `--arch x86_64`, never `ARCHS=arm64 x86_64`, and never `lipo -create` — that
   is how a universal binary gets made, and there is no x86_64 build.
2. **Assert it, do not assume it.** After building, check the artifact:
   `lipo -archs <binary>` must be exactly `arm64`. A build that silently produced
   a fat binary is a release defect, not a build option.
3. **Every release carries the artifacts.** A tag alone is not a release. If the
   Release page has no binaries attached, the release did not happen.
4. **No hardcoded build-toolchain triple in a path.** `.build/release` is the
   stable spelling. `.build/arm64-apple-macosx/release` points at nothing on a
   newer toolchain and at a stale binary on this one. The one exception is a build
   that explicitly passes `--arch arm64`: then the triple directory really is
   where SwiftPM writes, and that build must also assert the arch (§1.2.2).
5. **One checksummed artifact per target, or one checksum file covering all of
   them.** Never publish a binary without a digest beside it.
6. **Dry run by default; publish only on an explicit flag.**
7. **Never fetch a model, dataset or dependency to make a gate pass.** A check
   that cannot run is reported *not checked* — and the release notes must name it.
   "Not checked, no input" and "checked and identical" are different sentences.

## 1.3 Identity

The version or build number is **single-sourced and enforced**, not maintained by
hope.

- **One authoritative value.** A file at the repository root — `VERSION` for a
  semantic version, `BUILD_NUMBER` for a build number. Anywhere else it appears
  is a **mirror**, and the build or CI must fail when a mirror disagrees.
- **Pick one scheme and state it.** Semantic versions (`vX.Y.Z`) or build numbers
  (`b1`, `b2`). Do not mix them, and do not "helpfully" introduce versions into a
  project that uses build numbers.
- **The build refuses a malformed or inconsistent identity.** Fail at configure
  or compile time, not at release time.
- **Identity is observable.** A user must be able to say what they are running
  from the artifact alone: the archive filename, or the program's own answer, or
  both.
- **Bump once, propagate mechanically.** Provide a command that writes the mirrors
  from the authoritative value. A release is one edit plus one command.
- **A second declaration in a test is a defect.** Derive the expected value from
  the source of truth; a literal in a test means every bump fails a test that is
  not about the version, and the tempting fix — editing the test — is how a wrong
  version ships.
- **Multi-library projects version in lockstep.** Libraries that ship together and
  interoperate carry the **same** version, because a caller pairing them has no
  other way to know the pair is compatible. A library with no code change is
  recompiled and republished at the new number rather than left behind.
  Lockstep applies to the **library version only** — an ABI version, protocol
  draft, or schema version is a separate axis and must not be dragged along.

## 1.4 Preconditions

Before starting, confirm and record: the OS floor and toolchain floor are met
(`sw_vers`, `swift --version`); there is disk for a clean scratch build plus the
staged archive; `memory_pressure -Q` is acceptable; **no competing build or model
process is running**; `gh auth status` is the repository owner's account; the tree
is clean; and `HEAD` **is** the tag.

**Never terminate a process you did not start.** If one is blocking, name it with
its parent and age, and stop.

## 1.5 Gates

Run these in order, and make each one **able to fail**:

1. **Lint** — the project's own lint gates.
2. **Full test suite**, serially, and it must report the count that passed.
3. **Parity or golden checks** — real inference, real rendering, real protocol
   frames; whatever "the output is unchanged" means for this project.
4. **A clean scratch build** with the log scanned for warnings.

Two traps, both of which have shipped broken gates in this organisation:

- **A gate that cannot fail is not a gate.** A guard that looks for a file the
  build never produces passes for every input. A warning scan over an *incremental*
  build compiles nothing and passes vacuously — always use a fresh scratch path.
  Before trusting a new gate, break its input and watch it fail.
- **Guard the plan, not the byproduct.** Ask the build system what it resolved
  (`swift package describe --type json`, `cmake --build ... -t help`) rather than
  checking for artifacts after the fact.

## 1.6 Packaging

The archive contains, at minimum:

- the **executables or libraries**, built for arm64;
- **resource bundles** — a Swift binary without its `.bundle` cannot load its
  Metal kernels, and this fails at runtime rather than at build time;
- `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE` / `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` where third-party code is
  redistributed;
- a **`README-binaries.txt`** stating the platform floor, that the build is
  Apple-Silicon-only, and that the binaries are **not code-signed or notarized** —
  with the quarantine command (`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine <path>`) so a user
  who verified the checksum can run them. Do not imply a notarized build.

Name the archive `<project>[-<library>]-<version>-macos-arm64.tar.gz`; the
library segment is required only for a multi-library project, and exists so two
artifacts of the same release are distinguishable.

## 1.7 Publishing

```bash
gh release create "$TAG" "$ARCHIVE" "$ARCHIVE.sha256" \
  --repo <owner>/<repo> --title "<Project> $VERSION" \
  --notes-file "$NOTES" --latest
```

**Pin `--repo` on every `gh` call.** In a fork `gh` defaults to the *parent*
repository, so `gh release list` shows another project's releases and
`gh release create` fails with a misleading "tag has not been pushed".

## 1.8 Release notes

- Full notes in `docs/release-notes-vX.Y.md` (or the repository's equivalent),
  one section per user-visible change, each naming the check that backs it.
- End with a checksum block carrying `SHA256_PENDING` and
  `ARCHIVE_BYTES_PENDING`, substituted at publish time. **Never copy a size out
  of a dry run** — publish rebuilds, and the archive differs.
- `--publish` must **refuse** unless the notes carry the placeholder or quote the
  real value. A release quoting the wrong digest is worse than one quoting none.
- Name **every** check that did not run, and why.
- The README gets **no release callout**. It changes only when a fact it states
  changes. The changelog is the announcement.

## 1.9 After publishing

Verify the Release: the notes quote the digest in the `.sha256` beside it, the
assets are the archive and its checksum, and the changelog points at the same tag.
Leave previous releases' notes and performance tables alone.

## 1.10 Cross-repository

- **This file is the master; every repository's copy is deployed from it.** The
  master is `docs/release-rules.md` in `TinyTitan`, which holds Part 1 once and each
  repository's Part 2 side by side. It is deployed to each repository's `RELEASE.md`
  and to the `## Releasing` section of its `AGENTS.md`. **The deployment is manual.**
  A generated copy is no longer produced: the tool that made one wrote to every
  repository unconditionally and opened a pull request in each, and it was removed
  rather than guarded. Edit the master, then update each copy by hand to match.
  There is **no drift gate** to catch a copy that falls behind, so keeping them in
  step is a discipline, and a copy that disagrees with the master is a defect.
- **Repository rules live in the master, not in shell-script comments.** A rule an
  agent cannot find is a rule that will be broken.
- **`AGENTS.md` is the one instruction file, and every harness must reach it.** This
  account works with Codex, Claude Code, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Qwen Code,
  Qoder and Zed. Six read `AGENTS.md` directly; **Claude Code does not** — its
  documentation is explicit that it reads `CLAUDE.md`, not `AGENTS.md` — so every
  repository also carries a committed `CLAUDE.md` whose entire content is the
  `@AGENTS.md` import. Commit it: a symlink made on one machine is invisible to a
  fresh clone, to CI and to every other checkout, and on Windows it needs
  Administrator rights. Qwen Code reads `AGENTS.md` alongside its own `QWEN.md`, so
  there is nothing to duplicate for it.
- **Never add a file that shadows `AGENTS.md`.** Zed takes the *first match* from
  `.rules`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`,
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENT.md`, and only then `AGENTS.md` — so any
  of those six silently replaces this file for every Zed user.
  Check for them by hand in every repository; the drift gate that used to fail on one
  was removed with the deployment tool.
- **An archived repository is read-only.** Nothing can be committed to it, so no
  release step may depend on one. Name the exclusion rather than leaving a gap.
- **A check that has never been seen to fail is not yet trusted.**

# Part 2 — This repository

## YTLive_Laundry — Python, no release yet

- **Identity** semantic version, not yet established. There is no version literal
  anywhere — every tunable is declared in `conf/stream.env`.
- **Repository is public.** Its views badge uses the README-embedded static form
  rather than the endpoint form; either works, and it is left alone rather than
  churning the README. Converting it means moving it into the `REPOS` list in
  `~/bin/traffic-badge-update.sh` and swapping the badge for the endpoint shape.
- **No compiled artifact.** A release here would be a source archive of `bin/`,
  `conf/` and `install.sh` plus its digest — there is nothing to build, and Part 1's
  macOS packaging sections do not apply.
- **No CI.** `.github/` does not exist here, so nothing runs `bin/smoke_test.sh`
  automatically; it is a local gate only, and a green check elsewhere says nothing
  about this repository.
